- add Venture(s) and Holding(s) to company type list
- merge full company entries, not just sets of normalized names
- company merging
  - allow matching name as short name if company has that brand
  - (e.g. The Coca-Cola Company has the brand Coca-Cola)
- reconstruct brands list
  - always include rated brands
  - try not to use climate_counts if we can avoid it
  - strip blank, "Other"
  - assume short name is also brand unless:
    - company name ends with group, enterprises, etc.
    - company name starts with a brand name (e.g. "Kraft Foods")
    - master company data omits it
    - if no brands, use short name!
- merge/capitalize categories


Corner cases (handle last):
- BIS Global (DBA: CharityEngine) (use DBA name)
- Joey's Pizza Services (Deutschland) GmbH == Joey's Pizza Services
- BBned / Tele2 Group (/-separated variants? subsidiaries?). Not A/S!
- Subsidiaries (data structure)
